          Valuation programs for civil engineers are designed to equip
          professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to accurately
          determine the financial worth of construction projects, infrastructure
          developments, or real estate properties. These programs cover various
          methodologies and techniques used in valuation, including cost
          approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach. Ultimately,
          valuation programs empower civil engineers to make informed decisions
          regarding investment, development, and management of assets in the
          built environment.

          A popsicle stick building shake table competition challenges
          participants to design and construct a miniature building model using
          popsicle sticks, plywood, and glue gun. In this exciting event,
          participants will showcase their creativity, engineering skills, and
          understanding of seismic principles by designing and constructing a
          building model using Popsicle sticks and other provided materials. The
          goal is to build a stable building of a popsicles that is capable of
          resisting simulating seismic activity by shaking and vibrating. <br />

          held on 5th, 6th and 7th Magh, 2080 in collaboration of DELTA 4.O. We
          had various categories to judge the winner as the points were divided
          for maximum load stood on vibration Strength test, design,
          architectural view, neat and cleanliness, explanation etc. <br />
          With keen eyes for detail and a passion for innovation, the
          competition was judged based on criteria such as stability,
          functionality, and accuracy of seismic simulation and we come up with
          the horizontal shake table for the first time in ERC. The judges for
          the Popsicle Stick Building Shake Table Competition are experts in
          engineering and design. And we have the judge as{" "}

          A hydropower model demonstrates the process of generating electricity
          from water flow, typically using a small-scale representation of a
          hydroelectric power plant. By observing and interacting with the
          Hydropower Model, students and enthusiasts can learn about the
          renewable energy potential of hydropower, the components of a
          hydroelectric power plant, and the environmental and social
          considerations associated with hydropower development. <br />
